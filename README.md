you should get a more consistent bhop + it can write into the game.

how is it undetected?:

- utilizes windows native functions to create a handle from another process.
- technically undetected for reading and both writing.

how to use:

1. download the release https://github.com/dorrisdev/maehop-hijack/releases/ or build it yourself
2. press f4
3. farm some clips

how to setup:

1. configure your ide so you're using a multibyte character set.
2. update the offets in main.h using an offset updater.
3. build and run.
