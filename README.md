# **MaeHop: External Bhop Hack**

### **Why is MaeHop Undetected?**
- MaeHop leverages Windows native functions to create a handle from another process. 
- It guarantees undetection for both reading and writing operations because VAC (Valve Anti-Cheat) is not kernel-level.

### **Usage Instructions:**
1. [Download the latest release](https://github.com/glamempireaus/maehop/releases/) or compile the source code yourself.
2. Launch the application and press `F4`.
3. Enjoy the benefits!

### **Setup Guide:**
1. Ensure your Integrated Development Environment (IDE) is set to use a Multibyte Character Set.
2. Update the offsets in `main.h` using a reliable offset updater tool.
3. Compile, run, and you're all set.
